<h1>NiC^</h1>
         NiC^ is created for the upliftment of all women. This logo will also be face for the clothing line I intend to create in the spring of 2018. I will also use this logo to represent ethnic and cultural background of women. This (NiceUp) is a term used to describe a woman that does well for herself and takes care of her responsibilities on her own. This is also a self-sufficient woman that adorns herself in a respected particular manner. In addition this logo pertains to woman of Color, Creed, Religion, Orientation, Big small thick slim etc. Letâ€™s stop being bad bitches and become NiceUps
<h3>how man times can you say NiceUp NiceUp?<h3>
